# Pong For One
A game like its namesake, but for one person seeking a personal score.

## The Rules:
Near the screen's bottom, you take control of a slippery bar that can move left or right. As you do so, a ball descends and you must repel the ball with your bar. 

Each time your bar successfully connects with the ball, you earn a point. 

If you miss and the ball passes you, the game is over.



## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 rfk 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- game_data                 (source code for game)

  +-- pong_bar.py            (specific game classes)
